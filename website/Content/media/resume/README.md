The output from [making](https://github.com/TexAgg/Resume/blob/master/Makefile) my resume goes here.
These should be:
* main.pdf
* main.html
* main.css

To generate these files, 
in the root directory for my [resume](https://github.com/TexAgg/Resume/blob/master/Makefile)
run
```
make && make web
```
then copy and paste the files mentioned earlier.
