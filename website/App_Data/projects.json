Type '\\help' to see a list of his available commands. He also pushes relevant messages to a database, sends me email updates, and posts weather updates every 3 hours, but new features are constantly being added. I hope to one day make him a full-on companion, such as Siri or Watson (albiet not as realistic). For more information, see <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/gaikema/danksinatra/wiki/Home\">here.</a>",
