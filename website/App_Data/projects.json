Type '\\help' to see a list of his available commands. He also pushes relevant messages to a database, sends me email updates, and posts weather updates every 3 hours, but new features are constantly being added. I hope to one day make him a full-on companion, such as Siri or Watson (albeit not as realistic). For more information, see <a href='http://bit.ly/2qnFFXF'>here.</a>",
