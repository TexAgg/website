Rewriting my website (again) using ASP.NET.
This is more for fun and probably will not be hosted.

## Instructions

### Building
To download my resume and static web projects into the correct directories,
run `download.py`.
This must be done,
otherwise certain files will be missing and you will get 404 errors.

### Running
I developed this on Linux using Mono,
so I honestly don't know if it will run on Windows (thought it should).
