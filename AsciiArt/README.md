# AsciiArt
Following the tutorial [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20435/Using-C-To-Generate-ASCII-Art-From-An-Image).
The original project was [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ks11j4acx5ld9fd/AAAGaSyg12cR4Px1j9kXYUcDa?dl=0), but I moved it into the website solution so I could link the namespaces.
